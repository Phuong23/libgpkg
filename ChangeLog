  queries. This optimization is enabled when libgpkg is compiled and used with SQLite 3.8.3 or greater.
- Correct handling of NULL parameters in ST_Relate
- Improved reliability of GEOS function availability checks
- GEOS function availability is now determined at runtime rather than at compile time. This makes libgpkg more reliable
  when it is dynamically linked with GEOS.
